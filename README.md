##Gotta Go!

#The crowdsourced mobile application for people who drive a lot.

This application combines the use of MySQL, Sequelize, EJS, and Bulma to create a user-friendly crowdsourcing experience. Drivers for services like Uber or Lyft sometimes need to find restrooms in areas they don't know very well. This is where Gotta Go comes in: drivers can locate local restrooms (as well as cafes and gas stations) based on other driver recommendations.

This application was created as a group project for the UC Berkeley Extension Coding Boot Camp in November 2017.
